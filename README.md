Fork from prenagha/snooze.mmbundle

Just adapting a few things to meet my needs. In particular:

* Using tag "$snoozed" instead of the "Later" IMAP-Folder. This allows me to keep my folders organized and also snooze sent mail (which I like to keep in the "Sent"-Folder

* Adding an option to Cancel the Picker-Dialogue

* (Optional) Allow to remove the "x-snooze"-header.

* (Optional) Fix a number of issues if possible:
** I view all my snoozed email in a smart folder plus subfolders for each snooze date. Unfortunately, when changing the snooze date, the mail remains visible in the old folder. This is only corrected after MM restarts.
